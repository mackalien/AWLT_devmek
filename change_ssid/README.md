# Update SSID Password via API command Line

Run in Python CLI, Enter your Meraki API Key and navigate through the presented Menus to find available SSIDs in your organization and modify the chosen SSID.

Though I have tried to cover some improper user data entry, I have not implemented try/catch exceptions so this version is highly "breakable" by improper user input.
My First Project, written from scratch.

Resources used: Material from Cisco Meraki and Cisco Live.
